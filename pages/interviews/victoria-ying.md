## Victoria Ying

### Who are you, and what did you write

My name is [Victoria Ying](https://www.victoriaying.com/) and I write and illustrate YA and Middle Grade graphic novels! 

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I use [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/download) for writing my scripts, I use [Comic Draw](https://plasq.com/apps/comicdraw/ios/) for the iPad to do layouts, I use [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad) for inks, I use [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) for colors and I use [InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html) for final layout and lettering! Whew! Lots of applications!

### When and where do you write?

With graphic novels, some people write as they draw, but it’s always been easier for me to have a full complete script before moving onto any of the art. I get an approved script before I do any drawing. I usually like to write in snatches of the day. I have ADHD and while it can be difficult, I’ve also found ways to work with it to be able to write and finish projects. I work best when I can find a solid 30 minutes between other work and set down words to the page.

### What's your dream writing setup?

I need distraction so my current set up with my computer, the internet, a cup of iced coffee and my timer are the best. I can get easily distracted, but if I set up a timer to go off every 15 minutes, I can usually get a good chunk of words in! I also love moving around. Often I’ll take my laptop and go to a different part of the house just to get some variety into my system.
