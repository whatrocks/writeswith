## Aimee Lucido

### Who are you, and what did you write?

My name is [Aimee Lucido](https://aimeelucido.com/) and I am the author of [EMMY IN THE KEY OF CODE](https://aimeelucido.com/books/emmy-in-the-key-of-code/) and the upcoming [RECIPE FOR DISASTER](https://aimeelucido.com/books/recipe-for-disaster/).

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I write with a combination of [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) and [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). Which one I use depends on the type of project and where I am in the process.

### When and where do you write?

I write almost exclusively on the couch in my living room, but the “when” really changes from day to day, project to project. Lately I’ve been writing in the mornings, as soon as I’ve had my breakfast and open my computer, but sometimes I’ll procrastinate my writing times to the afternoons. And sometimes I’ll have weeks when I don’t write at all!

### What's your dream writing setup?

As long as I have my laptop and a couch of some sort, I’m pretty happy. I need quiet, at least 30 minutes or so uninterrupted, but I’m not too picky about the when and the where.
