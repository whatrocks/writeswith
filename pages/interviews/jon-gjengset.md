## Jon Gjengset

### Who are you, and what did you write

I’m [Jon Gjengset](https://thesquareplanet.com/), and I’m primarily known as a guy who does programming education through [live coding videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset). I just (as of September 2021) finished writing [Rust for Rustaceans](https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans), a book aimed at teaching those who already know the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) how to make better use of it and understand more of the underlying building blocks.

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I wrote the book partially on my beloved [ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/thinkpad-x1-carbon/), and partially on my own home-built desktop computer, both running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with a heavily customized desktop setup ([bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) + [ulauncher](https://github.com/Ulauncher/Ulauncher/) + [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/)). I personally prefer writing in markup languages like Markdown and LaTeX, but for my book I used [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) so that I could work with [No Starch](https://nostarch.com/writeforus)’s templates and editorial process, and [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince) to annotate the PDFs after they’d gone through layout (normally I prefer [mupdf](https://mupdf.com/) for PDF files).

I kept all my notes, LibreOffice documents, and layout review PDFs in a single [git](https://git-scm.com/) repository, so that I could easily check out past versions of documents if need be. I’m also hoping to use that later on to visualize my writing progression.

The whole book was written on a [Mistel Barocco MD600](https://mistelkeyboard.com/products/403141daeeeeb8dc68707c70cd07de48) split mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Clear Switches, and on an Uplift automatic standing desk. Though I must admit for some reason I could never write while standing, even though I have no problem with programming while standing.

### When and where do you write?

While writing I was always either a full-time student or a full-time employee, so nearly all of my writing happened in the evenings. I generally had Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings reserved for writing starting after dinner and going until bed. I would also spend a full or half day every other weekend or so to get some longer writing sessions in. I found that keeping a relatively formal schedule with sessions that weren’t too long, and with space in between, helped keep me motivated. Though I will admit that it was sometimes hard to get started after a long day of studying/working — music, tea, and a willingness to say “today I’m not productive, I’m going to stop” helped with that.

I did all my writing at my desk at home, though I moved from Boston to Los Angeles half-way through the book so in practice that means it was written at two desks.

### What's your dream writing setup?

Hot water dispenser nearby for tea refills ([Twinings Earl Grey](https://twiningsusa.com/products/earl-grey)). Nut mix (Whole Foods’ [Eagle Rock trail mix](https://smile.amazon.com/365-Whole-Foods-Market-Organic/dp/B086HMBTT8/)) for belly refills. Cat nearby for petting refills. Girlfriend nearby for cuddle refills. Playlist with non-distracting music that is not too slow, not too fast, and also not too repetitive in the background. And windows to look out through while thinking — preferably onto a street with people on it to observe.
