### Who are you, and what did you write?

I’m a 28 year old woman who lives in Brooklyn, and I am an aspiring storyteller (but I also work in product management in tech). I wrote a children’s book called [The Big Bold Blue](https://www.instagram.com/thebigboldbluebook), and it’s about a little boy who learns to be brave and do big, bold things!

### What hardware and software do you write with?

[Google docs](https://docs.google.com) on a [Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/)!! And the [Notes app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109) on my [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11).

### When and where do you write?

I use the Notes app on my phone to jot down phrases and paragraphs in various locations, since you never know when inspiration will strike. Besides that, I write on my laptop on weekday nights, with nice mood lighting from a lamp nearby.  

### What's your dream writing setup?

I would really love some way to write quickly without having to stare at a bright screen. My workday is full of screens, so it’s nice to unplug and get a little romantic with writing after work. The laptop screen really kills that romantic vibe. I suppose I’m describing a typewriter, but with a better keyboard and some sort of way to quickly edit the paper. If anyone reading this is inclined to build this, please let me know -- I will be your first customer! 

And in terms of the environment, I think my dream would be to write in a steamy, candle-lit hammam for hours. Like I said, romance.
