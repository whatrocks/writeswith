## Al Sweigart

### Who are you, and what did you write

I'm [Al Sweigart](https://alsweigart.com/). I write books that teach kids and office workers to program. I'm mostly known for [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), but I've written several other programming books as well. I make them all freely available under a Creative Commons license on my [website](https://inventwithpython.com).

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I tend to use [Thinkpad laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad) running Windows, though Windows 10 has finally annoyed me enough that I'm going to finally make the switch to Linux in the future. People are often surprised to hear that I write my technical books in [MS Word]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word)) instead of LaTeX. But I've found that Word just works, especially given the style sheet from my publisher, [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/).

I'll also keep notes in spreadsheets with Excel or Google Sheets, and in text files using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). I also use a Windows program called [Memento](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/memento/9nblggh09k4f#activetab=pivot:overviewtab), which lets me assign a hotkey to instantly bring up an always-on-top simple notepad window that I can type text into. It's really a great little app.

### When and where do you write?

Mostly at cafes or libraries. I've tried coworking spaces and they just didn't provide me with anything I couldn't get from a cafe. I enjoy having a place where I'm in public and in "work mode". Though with the pandemic, I've just been writing from home in my office. I'll try to keep 9 to 5 hours, but really I'm writing whenever I can put myself in the mood, including evenings and weekends.

### What's your dream writing setup?

I remember seeing The Matrix and the scene that shows Neo asleep at his computer. He has a one room apartment and a desk crowded with computer equipment. It's kind of dark and grimy. I thought, "That is what I want my workspace to be." And it pretty much is, except my space is cleaner and better lit. Still, the hacker noir vibe is strangely appealing to me.
