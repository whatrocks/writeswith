## Nat Guy

### Who are you, and what did you write?

My name is Nat. I’ve worked as a software engineer, an aerospace engineer, and a Japanese interpreter/translator. But I’ve also spent the last several years living in Japan and researching Japanese mushrooms. My recently released book, [Kinoko: A window into the mystical world of Japanese mushrooms](https://thekinokobook.com/) is the culmination of this work.

To copy from my Amazon blurb:

> Kinoko explores the rich history and cultural significance of mushrooms in Japan.

> Inside, you'll find colorful and interesting etymologies of Japanese mushroom names, translated essays and stories from Japanese authors, new translations of a hundred Japanese haiku about mushrooms, cultural insights about mushrooms in Japan, and a glossary and phrasebook of Japanese terms related to mushrooms and mycology. Whether you're a mushroom enthusiast, a lover of poetry and language, or simply interested in the outdoors, you'll find something to enjoy in this beautifully written and carefully researched book.

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I use [Google Docs](https://google.com/docs) to write out the text, edit, and collect feedback from friends. I also use [Google Sheets](https://google.com/sheets) extensively to collect data (mushroom names, collected poetry, etc.) before it’s ready to put into the main document. Finally, I do layout and final editing in [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html). I’m still a noob when it comes to InDesign, so I had a professional designer help me with layout for this project.

### When and where do you write?

I have two kids and a full-time job, so it’s hard to find time to write. I wrote the majority of this book late at night, in my home office, after everyone else had gone to sleep. When it comes time to do final editing, I’m old-school and prefer to print out what I’ve written and edit it by hand. I find that this helps me catch a lot of mistakes that I wouldn’t have found otherwise.

### What's your dream writing setup?

My writing requires a lot of research, so I need an office with lots of books, a comfy chair, and multiple monitors to help manage what I’m working on. I prefer to work in a quiet environment (at home) with a fast desktop PC and lots of desk space. And maybe a whiteboard for jotting down ideas.
