## George Jreije

### Who are you, and what did you write?

I’m George Jreije, the HarperCollins author of [SHAD HADID AND THE ALCHEMISTS OF ALEXANDRIA](https://www.left-bank.com/product/signed-shad-hadid-and-alchemists-alexandria), a children’s novel about a twelve-year-old Arab American immigrant who discovers he comes from a long line of alchemists.

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I write with a variety of hardware! Believe it or not, I wrote a solid chunk of almost every completed novel on my [iPhone 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11). The rest, I wrote on my [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), or more recently, on my [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/). Almost always, my software of preference has been [Google Docs](https://google.com/docs). I will occasionally use [Microsoft Word]((https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word) when exporting documents.

### When and where do you write?

I tend to write in small pockets of time throughout the day. If I can, the best time for me to write is immediately upon waking in the morning, on my phone in bed. It’s like the imagination juices are primed from a night full of dreaming. Otherwise, I’ll continue to write in small pockets until the day is through or I meet my word count goal. It doesn’t matter if I’m at the park, on a couch watching television, or taking public transport.

### What's your dream writing setup?

My dream writing set up is a cafe with floor cushions and tables for sitting on the floor. Tea is flowing, and there are plenty of books around for inspiration as well as space for other writers as well as some yoga between writing sprints. Not too much technology, perhaps an iPad only. Those would be the best conditions for writing and minimal (negative) distractions.
