## Suzanne Palmer

### Who are you, and what did you write?

I’m [Suzanne Palmer](http://zanzjan.net/), and I write primarily space-opera style Science Fiction, with occasional dips into Hard SF, Fantasy, and horror. My latest book is the third in the Finder Chronicles, [THE SCAVENGER DOOR](http://zanzjan.net/writing/scavenger-door.html), which came out on Aug. 17th 2021 from DAW Books.

### What hardware and software do you write with?

I primarily write on a Mac using [MS Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word), because it’s just simpler to write in manuscript format from the get-go and I’m used to it. That said, I’ve been known to be desperate enough to tinker with short excerpts in [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) (I don’t recommend this.) I write fairly linearly, at least with first drafts, so the simpler the tool the better. I also tend to do a lot of adjacent diagrams, maps, and other visual stuff in [Visio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visio), and I run my own private wiki for worldbuilding info.

### When and where do you write?

The actual physical act of writing I do mostly at home, especially since the pandemic started, though I used to occasionally gather with writer friends in coffee shops and cafes to write and toss ideas around. But, being very ADHD, a lot of the mental processes of writing just sort of run in the background all day long, and I solve a lot of plot problems while doing completely unrelated things. I have a full-time day job and kids, so I tend to write mostly in the evenings after dinner on weekdays, and whenever I can catch a few minutes on weekends. I function better with a certain amount of distraction, so I’m not dependent upon having long blocks of dedicated time or a fixed schedule.

### What's your dream writing setup?

I would like a Star Trek-style replicator next to my desk that can give me hot tea and cupcakes at will. Also, a small robot that sighs louder and louder the longer I have social media open instead of writing, and throws things at me if I get into arguments on facebook. Failing all that, I really should just invest in a water cooler.
