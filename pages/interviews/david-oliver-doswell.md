## David Oliver Doswell

### Who are you, and what did you write?

David Oliver Doswell. I wrote [Meredith: The Future of Silicon Valley](https://www.amazon.com/Meredith-Silicon-David-Oliver-Doswell/dp/B088T2ZZG5).

### What hardware and software do you write with?

MacBook. Literally [Apple Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/), until my editor had me switch to [Microsoft Word for Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-word/id462054704?mt=12). There’s more editing tools for writers there. At least there were at the time.

### When and where do you write?

At the time after work. I was a software engineer at PayPal during the pandemic and wrote on nights and weekends. Sometimes during the day between work, if my mind busted a spring. I write from my desk. I bought a glass office desk from Office Max in San Jose a few years ago. Pretty sturdy. I sit near a window in my apartment now in Los Angeles. I’m most comfortable here. Couldn’t do it in a coffee shop.

### What's your dream writing setup?

Pretty much what I have now: laptop, laptop stand, coffee. I’m writing something new and using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) this time.
