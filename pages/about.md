Writes With is a little site to ask writers about the tools and practices they use to get the writing -- and the edits -- done. Maybe you'll find some tips in here. I sure hope so!

## FAQ

### Wait - isn't this, like, very similar to [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com)?

It sure is! I chatted with [Daniel](https://waferbaby.com/) before launching Writes With as a writer-focused derivative of his most-excellent interview site, and he gave the thumbs-up.

### Who runs the site?

I'm [Charlie Harrington](https://charlieharrington.com), a computer programmer and writer in San Francisco.

### How can I submit an interview?

Reach out to [Charlie on Twitter](https://twitter.com/whatrocks).

### What do you use to make this site?

A couple things:

* [Stye](https://benreinhart.com/syte) (Static site generator) - created by my pal Ben Reinhart!
* Google Fonts (Fonts)
* GitHub (Source Control)
* CloudFlare Pages (Hosting)
